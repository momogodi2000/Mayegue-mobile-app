# Mayègue App - Critical Fixes Summary

## Date: October 1, 2025

## Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Provider Hierarchy Error (ProviderNotFoundException)
**Problem:** App crashed on launch with red screen error: "Could not find the correct Provider<OnboardingRepository> above this InheritedProviderScope<AuthViewModel?>"

**Root Cause:** The `OnboardingRepository` provider was defined AFTER the `AuthViewModel` that depended on it in the provider list.

**Fix:** Reordered providers in `lib/shared/providers/app_providers.dart`:
- Moved all `OnboardingRepository` related providers BEFORE `AuthViewModel`
- Removed duplicate onboarding provider definitions
- File: `lib/shared/providers/app_providers.dart` (lines 74-97)

### 2. ✅ App Logo and Launch Icon
**Problem:** Logo not displaying correctly on app launch

**Fix:**
- Verified logo file exists at `assets/logo/logo.jpg`
- Regenerated launcher icons using `flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons`
- Icons now properly configured for both Android and iOS
- Configuration in `pubspec.yaml` (lines 120-125)

### 3. ✅ Navigation Flow (Splash → Terms → Dashboards)
**Problem:** App stuck on blank/splash screen

**Fix:**
- Verified splash screen navigation logic in `lib/features/onboarding/presentation/views/splash_view.dart`
- Properly configured router with all routes in `lib/core/router.dart`
- Flow now works: Splash (3s) → Terms & Conditions → Landing/Dashboard

### 4. ✅ User Guides for All Dashboard Roles
**Status:** Already implemented and integrated!

**Verified:**
- Admin Guide: Accessible from Admin Dashboard menu → Navigate to `/admin-guide`
- Teacher Guide: Accessible from Teacher Dashboard menu → Navigate to `/teacher-guide`
- Student Guide: Accessible from Student Dashboard menu → Navigate to `/student-guide`

**Files:**
- `lib/features/guides/presentation/views/admin_guide_view.dart`
- `lib/features/guides/presentation/views/teacher_guide_view.dart`
- `lib/features/guides/presentation/views/student_guide_view.dart`

### 5. ✅ Environment Configuration
**Problem:** Hardcoded API keys and missing environment configuration

**Fix:**
- Created `.env.example` template file
- Created `.env` file for development
- Updated `app_providers.dart` to use `EnvironmentConfig.geminiApiKey` instead of hardcoded value
- Added `.env` to `pubspec.yaml` assets

**Action Required:** Users need to add their actual API keys to `.env`:
- `GEMINI_API_KEY` - For AI features
- `CAMPAY_API_KEY`, `CAMPAY_SECRET` - For CamPay payment integration
- `NOUPAI_API_KEY` - For NouPai payment integration

## Architecture Overview

### Clean Architecture Layers:
```
lib/
├── core/                    # Core utilities, services, constants
├── features/                # Feature modules (Clean Architecture)
│   ├── authentication/      # Login, register, phone auth
│   ├── dashboard/          # Role-based dashboards
│   ├── guides/             # User guides for each role
│   ├── onboarding/         # Splash, terms, onboarding
│   ├── payment/            # CamPay/NouPai integration
│   ├── lessons/            # Course content
│   ├── dictionary/         # Multilingual dictionary
│   └── ...
└── shared/                 # Shared widgets, providers, themes
```

### Provider Dependency Injection (Fixed Order):
1. Core Services (Firebase, Database, Network)
2. **Onboarding Providers** (Must be before Auth)
3. Authentication Providers & ViewModels
4. Dashboard ViewModels
5. Feature-specific Providers

## Current App Flow

### First Launch (Unauthenticated):
```
Splash (3s) → Terms & Conditions → Landing → Login/Register → Role-based Dashboard
```

### Authenticated User:
```
Splash (3s) → Role-based Dashboard
```

### Role-based Dashboards:
- **Admin**: `/admin-dashboard` - Full system management
- **Teacher**: `/teacher-dashboard` - Content creation & student management
- **Student/Learner**: `/dashboard` - Learning interface

## Temporarily Disabled Packages (Build Issues)

These packages are commented out in `pubspec.yaml`:
1. `record: ^5.1.2` - Audio recording (record_linux compatibility issue)
2. `sign_in_with_apple: ^5.0.0` - Apple Sign-In (build issues)
3. `speech_to_text: ^6.6.0` - Speech recognition (build issues)

**Recommendation:** These can be re-enabled once compatibility issues are resolved or alternative packages are found.

## Firebase Configuration

The app uses Firebase for:
- ✅ Authentication (Email, Phone, Google, Facebook)
- ✅ Firestore Database
- ✅ Cloud Storage
- ✅ Cloud Functions
- ✅ Analytics
- ✅ Crashlytics
- ✅ Performance Monitoring
- ✅ Push Notifications

Configuration: `lib/firebase_options.dart` (auto-generated by FlutterFire CLI)

## Payment Integration

Two payment gateways integrated:
1. **CamPay** - Cameroon mobile money (MTN, Orange)
2. **NouPai** - Alternative Cameroon payment gateway

Configuration required in `.env` file.

## Database

### 1. SQLite (Local - Pre-seeded)
- Pre-built database: `assets/databases/cameroon_languages.db`
- Contains language data for offline access

### 2. Firestore (Cloud - Real-time sync)
- User data, progress, subscriptions
- Syncs with local database via `GeneralSyncManager`

## Next Steps

### For Development:
1. ✅ Fix provider hierarchy - DONE
2. ✅ Fix navigation flow - DONE
3. ✅ Configure environment variables - DONE
4. 🔄 Run `flutter analyze` and fix any warnings
5. 🔄 Test authentication flow end-to-end
6. 📝 Add actual API keys to `.env` file
7. 🧪 Run integration tests

### For Production:
1. Update Firebase configuration for production environment
2. Add production API keys to `.env`
3. Enable code obfuscation for APK/IPA
4. Test payment flows with real transactions
5. Configure app signing for Play Store/App Store
6. Set up CI/CD pipeline

## Testing

Run tests:
```bash
# Unit tests
flutter test

# Integration tests
flutter test integration_test/

# Widget tests
flutter test test/widget/

# Build APK
flutter build apk --release

# Build IPA (macOS only)
flutter build ios --release
```
